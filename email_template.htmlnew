    <p>Hello User,

    </p>
    <p>
        At CVS, we are constantly trying to improve our service and would like to hear your feedback on how we
        performed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The survey is short and will only take 2 minutes to complete.
    </p>
    <p>
        And of course, there's a $90 promo reward for you after finishing.
    </p>
